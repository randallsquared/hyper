h:link is a super-set of [h:ref](/spec#href) allowing representation of
complex hyperlinks and parametrized actions (similar to HTML's Form element).

h:link points to an array of objects, where the order of such links should
not be considered significant.

Each object can have following properties of predefined semantic meaning:

###### uri

required. A URI [[RFC7320](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7320)] or
URI Template [[RFC6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570)], or a
[CURIE](https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-curie-20101216/) which expands
into a URI or URI Template.

###### template

optional. If this field is present, the value of the uri field should be
treated as a URI Template [[RFC6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570)]
after any [CURIE](https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-curie-20101216/)
expansion. When present, the template attribute is an object containing the
following properties:

1. `contentType` - a media-type that should be used to encode fields
      into, to satisfy the construction of a request.
      E.g. "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
2. `fields` - an objects that explains what data
elements should be submitted to the endpoint represented by `uri`. Each
key is the name of the variable to be sent. If variables are going both
in URI template and in the body of the request, and disambiguiation is
required choose names sensibly to avoid conflicts. Each field object
can have following properties:

    1. `label` : optional. Hint for human-friendly label to present to humans,
        if an input form is rendered.
    1. `required` : optional. Whether a value is required. Boolean true/false.
        Default: true.
    1. `type` : optional. One of: "text", "number", "date", "hidden" or "boolean".
        Defaults to "text".
    1. `default` : optional. Default value.
    1. `pattern`: optional. Restrictions on allowed values. Syntax must be the
        same as used in [pattern in HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/common-input-element-attributes.html#the-pattern-attribute)

###### rel

optional. An array of link relation types per
[RFC8288](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288). Only IANA-registered link
relation types SHOULD be refered to by simple names, all application-specific
and non-common link relation types should be URIs (usually CURIEed, to save
space).  The order of the link relations in this array should not be considerd
significant.

###### label

optional. String. Usually human-readable, for presentation hints.

###### action

optional. String. Indicates the action represented by the uri
transition. Hyper borrows definitions of possible action types from
[UBER](http://www.uberhypermedia.org) and the list of valid values is as
follows:

1. `append` : An unsafe, non-idempotent request to add a new item. (e.g HTTP POST)
2. `partial` : An unsafe, non-idempotent request to modify parts of an existing item. (e.g. HTTP PATCH)
3. `read` : A safe, idempotent request. [DEFAULT] (e.g. HTTP GET)
4. `remove` : An unsafe, idempotent request to delete an existing item. (e.g. HTTP DELETE)
5. `replace` : An unsafe, idempotent request to replace an existing item. (e.g. HTTP PUT)

##### Example of an Advanced Link:

```json
{
  "h:link": [{
    "uri" : "http://api.example.com/users/{user}/?x={xval}&y=foo",
    "action" : "append",
    "template" : {
      "contentType" : "application/json",
      "fields" : {
        "user" : {"pattern" : "[a-z0-9_-]"},
        "xval" : {"type" : "number"},
        "firstName" : {}, "lastName" : {},
        "role" : {"required" : false}
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

Please note that "user" and "xval" fill-in values in the URI template, whereas
"firstname", "lastname" and "role" are going to be transmitted as JSON HTTP POST
Body elements.

##### An h:ref as h:link Example

As noted earlier, h:link is a superset of h:ref, any h:ref can actually be
represented as an h:link. Case in point: the [earlier example](/spec#example-document-with-hrefs) of h:ref, when
represented as h:link would look as follows:

```json
{
  "h:head" {
    "title" : "Employees of North-East Department"
  },
  "department" : {
    "h:value" : "north-east",
    "h:label" : "North-East",
    "h:link" : [{"uri" : "http://api.example.com/departments/1234", "rel": ["about"]}]
  },
  "employees" : [

  ],
  "h:link" : [
    {"rel": ["self"],  "uri" : "http://api.example.com/users?dep=1234&page=4"},
    {"rel": ["next"], "uri"  : "http://api.example.com/users?dep=1234&page=5"},
    {"rel": ["prev"],  "uri" : "http://api.example.com/users?dep=1234&page=3"},
    {"rel": ["first"], "uri" : "http://api.example.com/users?dep=1234&page=1"},
    {"rel": ["last"],  "uri" : "http://api.example.com/users?dep=1234&page=10"}
  ]
}
```

As you can see, using `h:link` for simple references (single rel and a URI
accessed via HTTP GET) is a bit more involved than just using h:ref, which is
exactly why `h:ref` exists: to make easy cases easy. A lot of links are simple.
The "next", "prev", "first", "last" and "self" links, used for pagination being
most common examples. We decided that for easy cases there should be an easy
solution. That said, since h:link is a perfect superset of h:ref, you can write
all your Hyper documents without ever using h:ref, using h:link instead, and
they will still be perfectly valid.
